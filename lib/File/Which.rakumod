=head1 NAME

File::Which - Cross platform Raku executable path finder (aka which on UNIX)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use File::Which :whence;

  # All raku executables in PATH
  say which('raku', :all);

  # First executable in PATH
  say which('raku');

  # Same as which('raku')
  say whence('raku');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a Raku Object-oriented port of L<File::Which (CPAN)|https://metacpan.org/pod/File::Which>.

File::Which finds the full or relative paths to an executable program on the
system. This is normally the function of which utility which is typically
implemented as either a program or a built in shell command. On some unfortunate
platforms, such as Microsoft Windows it is not provided as part of the core
operating system.

This module provides a consistent API to this functionality regardless of the
underlying platform.
